Android Studio with Java was used to implement the framework hosting the multi-factor continuous authenticator mechanism that will be running on an android smartphone

## Data Collection
Gait Data were recorded based on a variety of user activities. Users were instructed to hold the device as they usually operate it, scrolling on social media and texting. This enable the reading of the device holding and using position to be recorded. Then, users were instructed to place the device in their pocket and take it out. The data captured the individual's way of storing the device away.

Additionally, to simulate everyday activities, users were instructed to put their device in their usual pocket and take a short walk enabling the device to collect gait data about their walking behaviour which will then be used to create identifiable patterns.

Keystroke Data were also captured in order to enable user identification based on their typing patterns.
